\tech use the actual traffic light signals and calculates which speed the driver should drive in order to reach the next green light.
It will in many cases be possible to avoid stopping and hence achieve an even flow through the traffic lights.
The fuel expensive acceleration is thus reduced.
\tech is simulated on a model of a real world network with four timed traffic lights without road sensors, and the results  are compared with GPS data.
Simulations show that adapting the speed to traffic ligths can improve the average travel time in heavy congested traffic roads by 32\% and 12\% outside peak periods. 
In addition the fuel consumption can be reduced with about $30$ \% for the individual driver without notable negative impact on the other traffic.
