%TODO: Too long...
If the phases of traffic lights are know, then vehicles can adjust their speed such that they reach the next junction just as it turns green. 
It will in many cases be possible to avoid stopping and hence achieve an even flow through the traffic lights.
The fuel expensive acceleration is thus reduced.
Simulations show that adapting the speed to traffic ligths improve the average travel time in heavy congested traffic roads by 31\%. 
In addition the fuel consumption can be reduced with about $34.7$ \% for the individual driver without notable negative impact on the other traffic.

\tech use the actual traffic light signals and calculates which speed the driver should drive in order to reach the next green light.
%In order for the system to work, it requires access to reading the state of the traffic light signals and that the driver as provided the route he will follow. 
\tech is simulated on a model of a real world network with four timed traffic lights without road sensors. 
The results of the simulations are compared with GPS data collected in the area.
The fuel reduction is acheived already for the first vehicle that use \tech and is maintained as more vehicles use the system.
It is a minimal investment for the individual driver that will directly benefit from the fuel reduction.
