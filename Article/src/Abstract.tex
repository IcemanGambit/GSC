If the phases of traffic lights are know, then vehicles can adjust their speed such that they reach the next junction just as it turns green. 
It will in many cases be possible to avoid stopping and hence achieve an even flow through the traffic lights.
The fuel expensive acceleration is thus reduced..
Simulations show that the fuel consumption can be reduced with about 25 \% for the individual driver without notable negative impact on the other traffic. 

The saving is acheived already for the first vehicle that use \tech and is maintained as more vehicles use the system.
It is a minimal investment for the individual driver which directly will benefit from the fuel reduction.

\tech access the traffic ligths and calculates which speed the driver should drive in order to reach the next green light.
In order to the system to work, it require access to reading the state of the traffic light signals and that the driver as provided the route he will follow. 
\tech therefore has few investment costs but a high profit for the drivers.
