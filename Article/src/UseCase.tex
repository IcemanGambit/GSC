\section{Use Case}
The proposed techinque, \tech is tested in the simulator SUMO on a part of Hobrovej, which is a frequently used road in Aalborg, Denmark.

\end{figure}

Hobrovej has seven cross sections, of which two have complicated light signals, two has simpel light signals, and three does not have any light signals. %TODO: too inconcrete!
The network is an exact replica of Hobrovej, with the same distance between sections, the same number of lanes and connections and the same traffic light signals and phases.
The routes and the number of vehicles in the network is also based on real observations from Hobrovej.
We only model vehicles of the types detailed in Tabel~\ref{tabel:vehicleTypes}, and do not model neither pedestrians nor cyclists.

In the following, we will focus our tests on the routes detailed in Table~\ref{tb:useCase:routes}.
\begin{table} %TODO: Should routes be all segments?

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}\hline
\textbf{ID} & \textbf{Route}\\\hline
51 & <Vesterbro, Hobrovej>\\\hline
?? & <Hobrovej, Vesterbro>\\\hline
