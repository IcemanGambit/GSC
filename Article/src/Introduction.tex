\section{Introduction}

%motivation
The physical laws of motion say that an accelerating vehicle consumes more fuel than a vehicle driving at a constant velocity. %TODO: Citation
If one wants to safe fuel, one should therefore try to accelerate as little as possible. 
However, several factors in todays traffic hinders drivers in driving at a constant velocity. 
These are for example interlacing roads, blocking vehicles, traffic incidents and of cause traffic lights. 
It is esimated at 1.8 bilion danish kroner is lost on fuel each year on vehicles stopping for red lights in traffic lights in Denmark \cite{Vejdir}.

%the problem of traffic lights
Traffic lights hinders the flow of traffic as it blocks vehicles arriving from one direction in order to allow other vehicles to drive through the intersection.
Each direction of the intersection is given a time period in which vehicles are allowed to pass through the intersection. 
From a drivers perspective it is only posible to guess when the light is going to change based on what has been seen so far. 

Looking at Figure \ref{fig:Introduction:network} vehicle $\veh_2$ is approacing the intersection.
%If he have spottet a red light for some time, it is likly that the signals are going to change soon. He can either, take the chance and keep driving at the same speed, until the last momment where he need to brake. Or he can slow down and limp toward the intersection and then maybe avoid a full stop at the traffic light. 
Now assume that vehicle $\veh_2$ knows the distance $\dist_2$ where he has to stop for traffic light $\tl_1$. 
Then also assume that vehicle $\veh_2$ knows that in $4$ seconds the traffic ligth $\tl_1$ will change to green. 
Then it is posible to calculate a speed for vehicle $\veh_2$ such that it will drive the distance $\dist_2$ in $4$ seconds. 
Now by the time it reaches the intersection the signal will have changed and thereby avoiding a full stop.

%problem of not knowing how many other cars are wating in line
The system proposed in this article, \tech, is designed on the basis that not every vehicle will be using it. 
Because of this, we cannot rely on communication between vehicles and therefore we do not know how many vehicles will be waiting in line for a green light. %TODO this depents on access to induction loop data
Hence we cannot predict the precise distance to the position at a traffic light where the driver must stop due to blocking cars. 
In Figure \ref{fig:Introduction:network} this can be observed where vehicle $\veh_1$ drives towards traffic light $\tl_2$. 
He believes that the distance to were he has to stop is the distance $\dist_1$, however, the two blue cars already waiting in line blocks a part of the road.

%TODO: Think we should skip this section
Some traffic lights do not always show the same signal to vehicles going in diffrent directions where it be straight, left or right turn. 
We model this by having \textit{connections} in the intersection. Each lane have an unique identifier as shown in Figure \ref{fig:Introduction:network}. 
Each possible legal pass through the intersection is then added to the \textit{connection table} as show in Table \ref{tab:Introduction:connectionTable}. Notis the road comming from north is unidirectional.

Road authorities try to design traffic light signals such that the flow of traffic is maximised in all directions.
This can be very difficult, especially in junctions with changing traffic density through out the day.
Two main techinques are used in traffic lights today: pretimed traffic controllers, where the signals loop between red, yellow and green in a predefined pattern; and traffic actuated controllers, where approacing vehicles are detected by road-side detectors such that the signals can be adjusted to the current traffic flow.
Traffic lights can also work togeather such that the flow of traffic can be maximised even futher. 
\textit{Interconnected controllers} cooporate with other nearby traffic lights to create for example green waves.
\textit{Agent controllers} is a more simple type of controller, that does not cooporate with other controllers.

%Modern traffic lights have sensors known as \textit{induction loops} that can detect vehicles driving on the roads.
%These sensors are used to regulate the signals in relation to the number of vehicles approaching the intersection \cite{Vejdir}. %TODO do we need this?
%If it is possible to reduce the stop-and-go behaviour at traffic lights, it might be possible to reduce the fuel consumption.

%section describing problem with sensors \TODO do we need this?
%A traffic light using only a timer to regulate the traffic is relatively easy to predict if the phases and cycle time is known. 
%However, when we introduce induction loops that are are effected by vehicles ariving in an unpredicteble pattern, then the traffic light will also to some extent become unpredicteble. 

%describe why we do simulation 
The focus of this article is to investigate whether it is possible to reduce fuel consumption at traffic ligths by matching the speed to the traffic lights. 
We investigate this through simulations with real world map data, traffic data and traffic light programs, both with crossing traffic and road-side senors. %TODO check we do this
%To investigate the extent of this problem we create simulations based on real world map data, traffic data and traffic light programs. 
We use the traffic simulator SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility)\cite{sumo} interfaced via TraCI (Traffic Control Interface)\cite{traci} which is a full scall microscopic traffic simulator.
