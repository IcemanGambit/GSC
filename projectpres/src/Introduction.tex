\section{Introduction}
\begin{frame}{Problem}
Fuel is a major expenditure

Want to use as little fuel as possible

Drive at constant speed use less fuel than accelerating
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Traffic Ligths}
Traffic ligths disrupt the flow of traffic

Not allways designed for free flow in all directions

Difficult to adjust speed to traffic light when the phases are unknown
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Problem Statement}
\begin{center}
Is it possible to reduce fuel consumption by adjusting the velocity of vehicles to traffic lights in a real life setting?
\end{center}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Solution}
Simulate real world traffic flow on a real world section of road

Calculate a speed to reach the next traffic ligth as it turns green
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Assumptions}
The used simulator simulates the real world correctly

Information about the traffic lights can be accessed by vehicles
\begin{itemize}
\item The GPS locations 
\item The phases, i.e. light setting time frames 
\end{itemize}

Vehicles 
\begin{itemize}
\item have a predefined route that is followed and not changed
\item know its GPS location
\item cannot communicate with other vehicles
\item have a constant acceleration and deceleration
\end{itemize}

Drivers follow the rules of traffic, e.g. 
\begin{itemize}
\item drives below the speed limit
\item do not drive into other vehicles
\item wait at a red light
\item wait for crossing crossing traffic
\end{itemize}
