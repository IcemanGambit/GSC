\section{Introduction}
\begin{frame}{Problem}
Fuel is a major expenditure in traffic
\vspace{5mm}

Want to use as little fuel as possible
\vspace{5mm}

Drive at constant speed use less fuel than accelerating
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Traffic Ligths}
Traffic ligths disrupt the flow of traffic
\vspace{5mm}

Not always designed for free flow in all directions
\vspace{5mm}

Difficult to adjust speed to traffic light when the phases are unknown
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Problem Statement}
\begin{center}
Is it possible to reduce fuel consumption by adjusting the velocity of vehicles to traffic lights in a real life setting?
\end{center}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Solution}
Simulate real world traffic flow on a real world section of road
\vspace{5mm}

For a subset of vehicles:\\
Calculate a speed to reach the next traffic ligth as it turns green
\vspace{5mm}

Investigate if the fuel consumption is reducsed
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Assumptions}
The used simulator simulates the real world correctly
\begin{itemize}
\item Driving behaviour
\item Fuel consumption
\end{itemize}
Information about the traffic lights can be accessed by vehicles
\begin{itemize}
\item The location
\item The phases, i.e. light setting time frames 
\end{itemize}

Vehicles 
\begin{itemize}
\item have a predefined route that is followed and not changed
\item know its location
\item need not communicate with other vehicles
\item have a constant acceleration and deceleration
\end{itemize}

Follow the rules of traffic, e.g. 
\begin{itemize}
\item wait at a red light
\item drives below the speed limit
\item do not drive into other vehicles
\item wait for crossing crossing traffic
\end{itemize}
