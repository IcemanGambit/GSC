\subsection{Without acceleration or deceleration}
Calculating the needed speed, $h$, when acceleration and deceleration is not taking into consideration, for arriving at the next traffic light while it is green.
We use the standard formula for calculating velocity and calculate two velocities: one for arriving at the traffic light just as it changes to green and one when it chances to red. The desired velocity is therefore somewhere in between.
\[h_g = \frac{s}{t_g}\]
\[h_r = \frac{s}{t_r}\]

\[h_r \leq h \leq h_g\]

where
\begin{itemize}
\item $s$ is the distanced between the vehicle and the traffic light
\item $t_g$ is the number of seconds before the traffic light changes to green
\item $t_g$ is the number of seconds before the traffic light changes to red
\item $h_g$ is the speed one needs to drive in order to arrive at the traffic light when it changes to green
\item $h_g$ is the speed one need to drive in order to arrive at the traffic light when it changes to red
\item $h$ is the recommened speed
\end{itemize}
