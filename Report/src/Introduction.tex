\section{Introduction}
By the physical laws of motion a car that decelerates and accelerates consume more fuel than a car driving at a constant velocity. %TODO: Need citation?
If it is possible to reduce the stop-and-go behaviour at traffic lights, it might be possible to reduce the fuel consumption.

We use the traffic simulator SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility)\cite{sumo} interfaced via TraCI (Traffic Control Interface)\cite{traci}.
